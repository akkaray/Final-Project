# Final-Project
Final project Summary
I have the data of Breeding birds from 2000-2005 distributed according to the county with the map, bird names, species ,breeding behavior with the possible date month and year data in the dataset, and I have 5 datasets of air quality index for each year from 2000 to 2005 distributed by county and each state, I plan to first write all the data in 5 sheets to one csv and then match the granularity of the given dates want to study the breeding behavior and breeding status on the days when the pollution levels are high versus the low level days.
